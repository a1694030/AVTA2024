# Classification and Fraud Risk Detection of Potential Credit Card Users Based on Hybrid Series Network
## Overview
&ensp;&ensp;This code repository presents a novel approach to quantifying financial risk, focusing on credit card fraud detection using a hybrid sequence network on a unique dataset from China Mobile's financial records. It includes feature extraction using LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost models, with the second stage involving TabNet architecture. This innovative architecture enables efficient discovery of potential credit card users and provides a new method for fraud risk detection.
